PARK Bearer scrip is represented by a digital token, which once purchased can be sold or traded via specialist crypto currency exchanges or the Omni decentralised exchange (online peer to peer market).

The LLC holding property is designed to function like a Trust would, as detailed in the LLC Operating Agreement. The offering described on this site is in the process of registering with most US states to be legally available under regulation D rule 504, the SCOR form details this registered disclosure. The cashflow contract with the LLC verifies PARK’s value proposition. A corporate resolution of the management company negates any beneficial ownership of the common stock by officers and leaves it as a pool to issue PARK tokens. An Impoundment Agreement defines how funds are to be handled in between being raised through sales of new PARK tokens and the purchase of new real property assets to back the issuance. The Subscription Agreement details the investment contract that purchasing PARK entails agreement with.  </div>

                    The Corporations Acts of some US states permit the issuance of a bearer scrip redeemable for the company’s common stock. In order to redeem the scrip, one must identify themselves to become legally registered as the owner of the shares. However the scrip is also legally considered a security, because it constitutes a sort of investment contract between the management company and the token holder.

                    US residents of any income level in states where we have completed a filing and registration of disclosure documents will be eligible to purchase PARK. We will enable the full purchase experience for residents of different states shortly after receiving approvals from the relevant authorities. The residents of most Latin American and African countries are able to legally invest in these tokens.

                <div id="faq4" class="collapse faqanswer">
                    The title to commercial real estate assets - parking lots in major UK airports - as well as a set of cashflow contracts, are legally owned by Limited Liability Companies (LLCs). PARK is issued by a management corporation that manages the LLCs. PARK is bearer scrip, but can be redeemed for common stock in the management corporation.<br>
                    Cashflow distributions paid to common stock holders, as to the holders of PARK tokens, may be subject to less optimal taxation and more filing overhead than being the holder of membership in one of the LLCs and receiving the cashflow directly as pass-through-income. That means, you are responsible for paying tax on the income in your home jurisdiction, or if a US person, as ordinary income at your marginal tax rate - with no tax overheads, no filings concerns, no reporting needed other than to add the income to your annual tax statement.<br>
                    LLC tokens are issued to replace PARK tokens redeemed, these are indivisible tokens that must not be moved from the address requested, or a change of Bitcoin address must be reported to update our register, in order to ensure there is an identity match between the registered owner and the controller of the address where the LLC tokens are held. Then, a larger cashflow distribution payment, which does not involve any tax withholding as affects the PARK token, will hit addresses containing LLC tokens.<br>
                    The added benefit of LLC membership is security - your registered identity is kept in the management company’s records and is protected by the privacy provisions Wyoming courts. If the LLC tokens are lost due to theft of a private key controlling a Bitcoin address, or perhaps a water mishap that fried the hard drive, a new tranche of tokens can easily be issued to replace the old ones, with that particular LLC’s cashflow distributions routing to them.

                <div id="faq5" class="collapse faqanswer">
                    The PARK product is structured like a trust but using the provisions of LLC organization and they By Laws of the management corporation. The management corporation has deferred ownership of its common stock to act as a pool-in-common for the purpose of functioning as a Real Estate Investment Trust, and no officer holds a beneficial interest in the common stock. The holding LLC operating agreements are extremely rigid and define only a few discrete actions that can be taken with the assets, and a strict pro-rata distribution of cashflow received minus a 2% fee. There are provisions for placing holders of PARK into LLC membership and visa versa, provisions for acquiring a specific number of properties, and no flexibility for management to liquidate assets except by election of members to exercise a buy-back option after a five year term. The management team is subject to regulatory oversight in terms of disclosed information associated with the security offering by the SEC in the United States and the FCA in the United Kingdom, as well as accounting standards to meet in conjunction with the requirements of the IRS and HMRC. This product rests on the shoulders of some of the strongest legal systems in the world with the most efficacious regulatory environments for financial products.

                <div id="faq6" class="collapse faqanswer">
                    PARK and other blockchain-based assets can be held in self-directed retirement accounts. Under US law, a Self-directed IRA custodian must be appointed and instructed to invest the IRA assets held in trust into an LLC that acts as one’s wealth management vehicle, and then that LLC can buy almost any asset in the world, including physical metals held in allocated vaults, property, bitcoin, term deposits that earn interest from leverage use on bitcoin exchanges, and assets issued over the Bitcoin blockchain. For the retirement account laws of other jurisdictions, consult a tax professional.

                    After an initial activation period, PARK tokens will receive weekly distributions and LLC tokens will receive monthly distributions. Initial activations of new LLC token tranches may be delayed due to variability in banking system clearance of payments.

                <div id="faq8" class="collapse faqanswer">
                    For the initial distributions, PARK holders will receive extra PARK, which is a divisible token that can be sub-divided down to eight decimals. After the activation of a modified version of the transaction type used, Tether Dollars (USDT) will be sent to holders of PARK and LLC tokens in burst transactions that put the right amount of fiat currency on the addresses of different tranche holders.

                <div id="faq10" class="collapse faqanswer">
                    PARK and USDT are both assets issued using the Omni Layer protocol, which adds bits of data to special Bitcoin transactions that get the same security benefits and immortal recording into the blockchain as normal Bitcoin transactions. The OmniDex is an extension of the protocol that allows anyone to trade any pair of assets directly over the Bitcoin blockchain with no custodian or middleman involved. It’s possible to sell PARK for USDT or EURT, as well as a handful of other technology project related assets with market capitalizations totaling over fifty million USD.<br>
                    The easiest way to hold, store and trade these assets is with the browser-based Omniwallet: www.omniwallet.org

                <div id="faq11" class="collapse faqanswer">
                    Scrip is an old word going back to the early days of banking, when gold smiths would issue gold scrip redeemable for hard bullion. Scrip in the modern day means a provisional certificate of money issued by bank or company, entitling the holder to redeem it for formal stock registration and dividends. Based on the Wyoming Business Corporation Act, C-corporations can issue a bearer scrip in whole or fractional form, the blockchain token that PARK holders control is such a scrip.

                    In finance, a derivative is a contract that derives its value from the performance of an underlying asset. The PARK bearer scrip is an equity derivative for the common stock of Blockchain Parking Management Unlevered. The management company allows scrip holders to deliver PARK to a company-controlled address and request registration in LLC membership, constituting a direct equity ownership, which allows higher yield and recourse for private key loss.

                <div id="faq13" class="collapse faqanswer">
                    Digitalization is the use of digital technologies to change a business model and provide new revenue and value-producing opportunities. While using the legal structures available to traditional Real Estate investment products, PARK is the first to use the Bitcoin blockchain to issue a security backed by real property and contractual cash flows. This marks the beginning of a new phase for Real Estate markets, where the move toward digitizing property into blockchain-recorded assets drives profits and includes more people than ever in the benefits of the market.

                <div id="faq14" class="collapse faqanswer">
                    Decentralization is the process of redistributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things away from a central location or authority. Bitcoin secures its ledger, colloquially referred to the “the blockchain”, with proof-of-work hashing power distributed across many for-profit miners running extensive computer hardware on 6 continents. Much of this mining power is concentrated in the top 5 mining pools, but also the composition of that top 5 has been very fluid compared to other industries. The Omni Layer protocol allows for asset creation, distributions to assets, and peer-to-peer trading over Bitcoin’s ledger. By providing a decentralized way for asset issuance and trade to occur, global capital can gain greater fungibility and optionality, protecting itself from confiscation and capital controls.                </div>
