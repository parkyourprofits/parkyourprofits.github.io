The title to commercial real estate assets - parking lots in major UK airports - as well as a set of cashflow contracts, are legally owned by Limited Liability Companies (LLCs). PARK is issued by a management corporation that manages the LLCs. PARK is bearer scrip, but can be redeemed for common stock in the management corporation.

Cashflow distributions paid to common stock holders, as to the holders of PARK tokens, may be subject to less optimal taxation and more filing overhead than being the holder of membership in one of the LLCs and receiving the cashflow directly as pass-through-income. That means, you are responsible for paying tax on the income in your home jurisdiction, or if a US person, as ordinary income at your marginal tax rate - with no tax overheads, no filings concerns, no reporting needed other than to add the income to your annual tax statement.

LLC tokens are issued to replace PARK tokens redeemed, these are indivisible tokens that must not be moved from the address requested, or a change of Bitcoin address must be reported to update our register, in order to ensure there is an identity match between the registered owner and the controller of the address where the LLC tokens are held. Then, a larger cashflow distribution payment, which does not involve any tax withholding as affects the PARK token, will hit addresses containing LLC tokens.

The added benefit of LLC membership is security - your registered identity is kept in the management company’s records and is protected by the privacy provisions Wyoming courts. If the LLC tokens are lost due to theft of a private key controlling a Bitcoin address, or perhaps a water mishap that fried the hard drive, a new tranche of tokens can easily be issued to replace the old ones, with that particular LLC’s cashflow distributions routing to them.

The PARK product is structured like a trust but using the provisions of LLC organization and they By Laws of the management corporation. The management corporation has deferred ownership of its common stock to act as a pool-in-common for the purpose of functioning as a Real Estate Investment Trust, and no officer holds a beneficial interest in the common stock. The holding LLC operating agreements are extremely rigid and define only a few discrete actions that can be taken with the assets, and a strict pro-rata distribution of cashflow received minus a 2% fee. There are provisions for placing holders of PARK into LLC membership and visa versa, provisions for acquiring a specific number of properties, and no flexibility for management to liquidate assets except by election of members to exercise a buy-back option after a five year term. The management team is subject to regulatory oversight in terms of disclosed information associated with the security offering by the SEC in the United States and the FCA in the United Kingdom, as well as accounting standards to meet in conjunction with the requirements of the IRS and HMRC. This product rests on the shoulders of some of the strongest legal systems in the world with the most efficacious regulatory environments for financial products.

PARK and other blockchain-based assets can be held in self-directed retirement accounts. Under US law, a Self-directed IRA custodian must be appointed and instructed to invest the IRA assets held in trust into an LLC that acts as one’s wealth management vehicle, and then that LLC can buy almost any asset in the world, including physical metals held in allocated vaults, property, bitcoin, term deposits that earn interest from leverage use on bitcoin exchanges, and assets issued over the Bitcoin blockchain. For the retirement account laws of other jurisdictions, consult a tax professional.

PARK and USDT are both assets issued using the Omni Layer protocol, which adds bits of data to special Bitcoin transactions that get the same security benefits and immortal recording into the blockchain as normal Bitcoin transactions. The OmniDex is an extension of the protocol that allows anyone to trade any pair of assets directly over the Bitcoin blockchain with no custodian or middleman involved. It’s possible to sell PARK for USDT or EURT, as well as a handful of other technology project related assets with market capitalizations totaling over fifty million USD.

	The easiest way to hold, store and trade these assets is with the browser-based Omniwallet: www.omniwallet.org
